## Introduction
This is a python program that will simulate various different searching algorithms in a 50x50 gridworld. The following searching algorithms will be performed:
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Greedy Best-First Search
- A* Search

## Usage
- Download all of the files
- Make sure required libraries are installed
    - If not
    - ``pip install matplotlib``
    - ``pip install shapely``
- Open CMD to the folder with search.py
- Run python search.py

## Information 
- Select by typing in the number corresponding to the search algorithm and hitting enter
- Keep the following matplot window open to watch the path.
- After the search is complete, a summary will be appended to the summary.txt
- Make sure to keep the matplot window open for any consecutive runs. 
- ``5. Run all`` will run every search algorithm and draw their paths on the same grid. Each summary will be appended to summary.txt.
